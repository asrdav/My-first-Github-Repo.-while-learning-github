When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would want to use a repository when i want help of other people on my project,etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  This is because we don't want all the changes to be incorporated in the local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are basically clones but only within the context of Github,clone is exact same repository whereas 
  branch is completely different.It is just facilitating the creation of commits.I would use forks in 
  place of clones in Github.
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  It's helpful in knowing the changes in Github repository while one is offline by updating the local copy
  of the Github repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  I would collaborate basically by emailing,texting,etc.On one side,it will help me in working on a lot of 
  the project on my own while on the other side,work increases and creativity decreases.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  The basic idea of using separate branches is when one wants to add a feature but at the same time 
  wants other people to collaborate as well.Saving changes directly to master is less complicated
  while creating separate branches helps in collaboration.
