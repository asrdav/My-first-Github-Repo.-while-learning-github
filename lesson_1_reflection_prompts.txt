How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   It helped me point out the exact error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    The previous versions provide more details of the file which is good.We
    can take in consideration the errors in the previous versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  Choosing manually gives an advantage of less and required amount of commits
  but at the same time chances are there that the commits are not made at right
  time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   As git is related to code writing,commits are made in larger amounts than Google
   Docs,which is not code-oriented.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives the entire history of the commits made while git diff gives us the 
    changes introduced in the current commit.As a result, both helps us in viewing 
    history of files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   It gives the user access of the whole code and the changes brought previously
   in the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To use github and collaborate with other people on software development.
